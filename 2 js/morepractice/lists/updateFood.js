/**
 * Array Map() Method
 * Reading Tip: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
 *
 * Map() is a great array method! It works by iterating over each element in an array,
 * manipulating each element, and returning a new array of the manipulated elements.
 * That's right! Mapping isn't just for cartographers anymore.
 *
 * Review the animals.js file in this folder and the array of animal objects in it.
 * Some humans dropped peanut butter cups in the zoo and the animals
 * got a hold of it. OOOPS!
 *
 * Write a function updateFood that updates the favorite food
 * of every animal to 'Peanut Butter Cups'.
 *
 * Try to come up with different variations of your function!
 * Try to solve it without using a for loop!
 *
 * BONUS: We want to keep track what the animals favorite food was before,
 * so do not change the original array but instead return a
 * new array of animals with the updated favorite food.
 * EXTRA TEST: Make sure to have the first test enabled by removing the 'x'
 * from the 'xit' to test your bonus solution
