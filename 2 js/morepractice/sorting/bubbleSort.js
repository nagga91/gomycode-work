/**
 * Implement a function that runs a "Bubble Sort" on the given unsorted array of numbers.
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort
 * 
 * Bubble sort works by swapping the first two elements if the first is greater than the second. 
 * Then, go to the next pair see if they need to be swapped, and so on, continuously looping over 
 * the array until no more swaps are needed and hence it is sorted. In doing so, the smaller items 
 * slowly "bubble" up to the beginning of the list.
 * 
 * Runtime: O(n2), Memory: O(1)
 * 
 * @param {array} nums - unsorted array
 * @returns {array} sorted nums array
